# XtendDacRules
This project contains a number of extra code analysis rules for SSDT.
The wiki contains a quick guide how to install the rules and a short description of the included rules.

If you do not want to compile the dll containing the rules yourself, have a look at the releases. It has a zip containing the compiled dll.
